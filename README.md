# PARM
PAR2 Activation-driven calcium Release Model

PARM is a small family of mechanistic mass action models of the activation of the G-coupled protein receptor, PAR2, and the subsequent downstream calcium signaling via the phospholipase C and IP3 pathway. The model was designed to mathematically model the underlying signaling dynamics relevant to the inactivation of PAR2 in HEK-293 cells by Molecular Hyperthermia as described in:

The models are encoded using the Python programming language-based systems biology modeling framework [PySB](http://pysb.org/). Model variants focus primarily on alternative hypotheses for GPCR/G-protein activation as well as different variations on how the FRET-based calcium sensor and resulting FRET ratio signal is modeled.
